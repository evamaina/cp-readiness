## About me
 Am a Quality Analyst at Sama source.I strongly believe that
 only I can change my life. Failure will never overtake me if my
 determination to succeed is strong enough. I just find myself
 happy with the simple things. My Education background
 is Bsc in Computer Science and Mathematics.


### Passion
 I have a great passion for coding and everytime I get home
 from work too tired I always ask myself one thing;What if all
 this exhaustion is as a result of spending all my time developing
 something? Doing what I love. Where could I be? Now here comes the 
 opportunity to do just that and I can't let go.Andela here I come.

#### Uniquiness
 I have always been told that am very different.That I live in my own world.
 Am yet to find out how .
